## Getting Started

Begin by cloning the repository to `T:/buildasign/bas-quote-generator`

### Installing

This repository contains both the server and client modules. Begin by running the following commands:

```
cd T:/buildasign/bas-quote-generator
npm install
```

After the server has finished installing, run the next set of commands:

```
cd src/client
npm install
```

### Development

We use the npm packages nodemon and concurrently to run/watch the server and client modules simultaneously. Run `npm run start:dev` from `T:/buildasign/bas-quote-generator` to launch the server and client.
